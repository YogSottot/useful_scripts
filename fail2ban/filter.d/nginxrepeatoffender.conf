 # Author: Mitchell Krog <mitchellkrog@gmail.com>
 # Version: 1.1
 #
 # Add on for Nginx Bad Bot blocker

 # Github: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza
 #
 # Tested On: Fail2Ban 0.9.3
 # Server: Ubuntu 16.04
 # Firewall: IPTables
 #
 # Dependancies: requires nginxrepeatoffender.conf in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d folder
 #               requires jail settings called [nginxrepeatoffender]
 #				requires nginx.repeatoffender file in /etc/fail2ban
 #				create with sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/nginx.repeatoffender
 #				chmod +x /etc/fail2ban/nginx.repeatoffender
 #
 # Drawbacks: Only works with IPTables
 #
 # Based on: The Recidive Jail from Fail2Ban
 #			This custom filter and action will monitor your Nginx logs and perma-ban
 #			any IP address that has generated far too many 403 or 444 errors over a 1 week period
 #			and ban them for 1 day. This works like a charm as an add-on for the Nginx Bad
 #			Bot Blocker which takes care of generating the 444 and 403 errors based on the extensive
 #			list of Bad Referers, Bots, Scrapers and IP addresses it covers.
 #			Thus custom Fail2Ban filter helps prevent the agressive one's from constantly filling
 #			up your Nginx server logs.
 #
 # This custom action requires a custom jail in your
 # jail.local file for Fail2Ban
 #
 # Your jail file would be configured as follows
 #
 # [nginxrepeatoffender]
 # enabled = true
 # logpath = %(nginx_access_log)s
 # filter = nginxrepeatoffender
 # banaction = nginxrepeatoffender
 # bantime  = 86400   ; 1 day
 # findtime = 604800   ; 1 week
 # maxretry = 20
 #
